# Contributing to iOSTestApp

Thanks for your interest in this project. It is an example of Swift and XCTest, and improvements are welcome.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from the default branch.
2. Make a small, focused change.
3. Run the checks locally:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project TestApp.xcodeproj -scheme TestApp \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16" CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

4. Open a pull request that explains what changed and why.

## Conventions

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages and pull request titles, for example `feat: add a login example` or `fix: correct the locator`.
- Keep pull requests small. One topic per pull request.
- Add or update tests when you change behaviour, and update the README when the way to run the project changes.
